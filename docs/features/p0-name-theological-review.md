# Theological Review: App Name Candidates

## Reviewer: Theologian Agent
## Scope: Hebrew & Greek name candidates for a Reformed church history learning platform

This document provides a thorough theological assessment of each candidate name, evaluating etymology, biblical usage, alignment with Reformed theology, and practical suitability. It also incorporates and responds to the Researcher's findings in `p0-name-research.md`.

---

## Evaluation Criteria (Theological)

1. **Biblical Rootedness** - Is the word used in Scripture? How central is it?
2. **Reformed Theological Alignment** - Does it resonate with the Reformed tradition's emphases (covenant theology, redemptive-historical hermeneutics, sola Scriptura, the five solas)?
3. **Semantic Fit** - Does the word's meaning naturally map onto "learning church history"?
4. **Connotative Safety** - Are there negative associations, theological controversies, or interfaith sensitivities?
5. **Memorability & Pronounceability** - Can English-speaking users easily say and remember it?
6. **Commercial Availability** - Verified via web searches (no major tech companies or apps).

## Part I: Hebrew Candidates

### 1. Toledot (תּוֹלְדוֹת) - "Generations / Historical Account"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From the Hebrew root y-l-d ("to bear, bring forth"). The plural noun toledot appears 39 times in the Old Testament, with 34 occurrences in Genesis alone. It functions as the primary structural device of Genesis, introducing each major section with the formula "These are the toledot of..." (elleh toledot). There are 10 such sections in Genesis, organized in two groups of five.

Critically, toledot does not refer to the *origin* of X but to *what X brought forth* -- what came after, what descended from, what resulted from. The toledot of Terah contains the story of Abraham. The toledot of Isaac is mostly about Jacob. This forward-looking orientation -- "here is the history that came from this person" -- is precisely what a church history app does: it traces what came forth from the apostolic church.

**Reformed Theological Alignment: EXCELLENT**
This is where Toledot truly shines. Reformed theology is distinctively committed to:

- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutics**: The Reformed tradition reads the Bible as one unified story of God's redemptive plan unfolding across generations. Geerhardus Vos, the father of Reformed biblical theology, built his entire framework on tracing God's progressive revelation through successive epochs. Toledot is the literary device that structures this very unfolding in Genesis.

- **Covenant theology**: Each toledot section in Genesis marks not merely a genealogical transition but a covenantal one. Yahweh's covenant with Noah represents an advance over Adam; Abraham's covenant builds on Noah's. The toledot structure traces the narrowing of the covenant line from universal (creation) to particular (Abraham's seed) -- the very pattern that Reformed federal theology emphasizes.

- **The Westminster Confession of Faith** (WCF 7) speaks of the "covenant of grace" administered in "divers times and diverse manners" across redemptive history -- this is precisely the toledot pattern.

- **Marten Woudstra** (Calvin Theological Journal) wrote an article titled "The Toledot of the Book of Genesis and Their Redemptive-Historical Significance," directly connecting this term to the Reformed redemptive-historical framework.

**Semantic Fit:** Perfect. "Toledot" literally means "the historical account / the generations that followed." A church history learning platform is, in essence, tracing the toledot of the apostolic church -- the generations of believers, councils, confessions, and movements that came forth from the New Testament era.

**Connotative Safety:** No negative associations. The word is distinctly biblical and not associated with any controversial modern movements. Unlike some Hebrew terms, it does not carry baggage from inter-denominational disputes.

**Pronunciation:** TOH-leh-doht. Three syllables, intuitive stress pattern. English speakers may initially say "toh-LEE-doht" but the correct pronunciation is easily learned. Variant spelling "Toldot" is also common and even simpler.

**Commercial Availability:** CLEAR. No tech companies, apps, or software products found. No trademark conflicts identified.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: RANK #1**
Toledot is the strongest candidate by a significant margin. It is deeply embedded in the structure of Scripture, perfectly aligned with Reformed redemptive-historical theology, semantically ideal for a church history platform, and commercially available. It says: "This app traces the generations of the church -- the story of what God brought forth through His people across the ages."

### 2. Maskil (מַשְׂכִּיל) - "Wise / Learned / A Teaching Song"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From the Hebrew root s-k-l ("to be wise, to have insight, to instruct"). Appears in the superscriptions of 13 Psalms (32, 42, 44, 45, 52, 53, 54, 55, 74, 78, 88, 89, 142) as a genre designation. Also appears in Daniel 12:3 ("the maskilim shall shine like the brightness of the firmament") and Amos 5:13 ("the prudent [maskil] keeps silent").

In the Psalms, a maskil is understood as a "teaching song" or "song of wisdom" -- a composition designed to impart insight through worship. The maskil psalms encompass diverse forms (confession, lament, historical rehearsal, royal hope) but share a common aim: wisdom through worship, catechesis through praise.

**Reformed Theological Alignment: GOOD, WITH A CAVEAT**
On the positive side:
- The Psalms are central to Reformed worship. Calvin called the Psalms "an anatomy of all parts of the soul." The Reformed tradition of exclusive psalmody (singing only Psalms in worship) makes a Psalm-derived term deeply resonant.
- The maskil emphasis on instruction through worship aligns with the Reformed commitment to catechesis (Westminster Shorter/Larger Catechisms, Heidelberg Catechism).
- Daniel 12:3's use of maskilim in an eschatological context ("those who are wise shall shine") adds depth.

**The Caveat -- Haskalah Association:**
In modern Jewish history, "maskil" (plural: maskilim) is the term for followers of the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment movement (1770s-1880s). The Haskalah, led by Moses Mendelssohn, promoted:
- Secular education over exclusively religious learning
- Integration into European society
- Reduced emphasis on messianic expectation
- Critical and rationalistic approaches to tradition

This is theologically significant. The Haskalah maskilim were, in many ways, the opposite of what Reformed theology values. They pursued secular reason over revealed truth, integration over distinctiveness, and rationalism over confessional fidelity. Orthodox Judaism opposed the Haskalah precisely because it threatened to undermine religious observance.

For a Reformed Christian audience, this association is unlikely to be widely known or problematic. However, in an interfaith or academic context, "maskil" carries this strong secondary meaning. It would be worth noting that a theologically informed Jewish audience might associate the name with secular Enlightenment rationalism rather than with Psalm-based wisdom.

**Semantic Fit:** Good but slightly indirect. "Maskil" means "one who has wisdom/insight" or "a teaching song." It emphasizes the *learner's disposition* or the *pedagogical mode* rather than the *content* (church history). It fits a learning platform generically but does not specifically evoke history.

**Pronunciation:** MAHS-keel. Two syllables, very easy for English speakers. Short, punchy, memorable.

**Commercial Availability:** CLEAR. No tech companies, apps, or software products found.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: RANK #2**
Maskil is an excellent runner-up. Its Psalm-derived meaning of "teaching song / song of wisdom" fits a learning platform well, and the Reformed love of the Psalms gives it theological resonance. The Haskalah association is a minor concern that most users would not notice, but it is worth acknowledging. Its main weakness compared to Toledot is that it emphasizes wisdom/learning generically rather than history specifically.

### 3. Zikkaron (זִכָּרוֹן) - "Memorial / Remembrance"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From the root z-k-r ("to remember"). Appears prominently in Exodus 12:14 where Passover is established as a zikkaron ("This day shall be a memorial [zikkaron] for you"), and in Joshua 4:7 for the memorial stones of the Jordan crossing. Also used for the "memorial portion" of grain offerings (Leviticus 2:2).

**Reformed Theological Alignment: MODERATE**
The concept of remembrance is important in Reformed theology, particularly in the theology of the Lord's Supper. Calvin argued that the Supper is a memorial that genuinely nourishes faith (contra bare memorialism). However, "zikkaron" is most naturally associated with liturgical remembrance (Passover, Eucharist) rather than historical study. The Reformed tradition distinguishes between worshipful remembrance (sacramental) and intellectual study of history -- and a church history app is more the latter.

**Semantic Fit:** Moderate. "Remembrance" is adjacent to "history" but not identical. You "remember" things you have experienced or that your community commemorates; you "study" things from the broader past. A church history app is more about study than about liturgical remembrance.

**Pronunciation:** zih-kah-ROHN. Three syllables, slightly unfamiliar to English ears.

**Commercial Availability:** PARTIALLY TAKEN. An Italian publishing company (Zikkaron Edizioni) and a Holocaust remembrance organization (Zikaron BaSalon) use the name.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: RANK #6**
Zikkaron has beautiful meaning but its semantic center is liturgical remembrance rather than historical learning, and it has some existing usage in cultural organizations.

---

### 4. Masoret (מָסוֹרֶת) - "Tradition / Transmitted Teaching"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From the root m-s-r ("to hand over, transmit"). Related to "Masorah" -- the tradition of careful textual transmission of the Hebrew Scriptures by the Masoretes. The concept of faithful transmission of received teaching is deeply Jewish.

**Reformed Theological Alignment: PROBLEMATIC**
Here is the critical issue: "Tradition" is a loaded word in Reformed theology. The Reformation was in significant part a rejection of unwritten tradition as a co-equal authority with Scripture. Sola Scriptura -- Scripture alone as the final authority -- is the formal principle of the Reformation. While the Reformed tradition does value confessional traditions (creeds, catechisms, confessions), it insists these are subordinate to and derived from Scripture.

Naming a Reformed app "Masoret" (Tradition) could be read as implicitly endorsing the Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox position that tradition carries independent authority alongside Scripture. This is a real theological sensitivity in Reformed circles.

**Commercial Availability:** TAKEN. Multiple businesses (Masoret GS, Masoret LLC, Masoret SA LLC).

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: ELIMINATED**
Both commercially unavailable and theologically problematic for a Reformed-tradition app. The word "tradition" sits at the fault line of the Reformation's most fundamental debate.

---

### 5. Hokmah / Chokmah (חָכְמָה) - "Wisdom"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
The primary Hebrew word for wisdom, appearing 149 times in the Hebrew Bible. Central to Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes. "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10) is a foundational text.

**Reformed Theological Alignment: GOOD**
Wisdom is valued in the Reformed tradition, and the Reformed emphasis on the "fear of the LORD" aligns well. However, "wisdom" is very broad -- it describes a quality of life, not a specific activity like learning history.

**Pronunciation:** khokh-MAH (or CHOK-mah). The initial guttural "kh" sound (like Scottish "loch") is genuinely difficult for most English speakers. This is a significant practical barrier.

**Commercial Availability:** No major tech company found, though the word is widely used in various religious contexts.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: RANK #7**
Beautiful meaning but too generic for a history-specific app, and the pronunciation is a real barrier for English-speaking users.

---

### 6. Mikra (מִקְרָא) - "Reading / Scripture / Convocation"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From the root q-r-' ("to call, to read"). Mikra can mean "reading," "that which is read" (i.e., Scripture), or "convocation" (as in "holy convocation," miqra qodesh, in Leviticus 23). In Jewish tradition, "Mikra" refers specifically to the written Hebrew Bible (as distinct from the Oral Torah).

**Reformed Theological Alignment: GOOD**
The Reformed emphasis on reading Scripture aligns well. However, Mikra specifically denotes Scripture-reading rather than historical study. A church history app teaches *about* the church through history, not primarily Scripture-reading.

**Commercial Availability:** PARTIALLY TAKEN. "Mikra Cellular Sciences" is an $8.5M-funded supplement company. "Micra Software & Services" is a consultancy. The name space is crowded.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: RANK #8**
The meaning is somewhat misaligned (Scripture-reading vs. history-learning) and the commercial space is already occupied.

---

### 7. Midrash (מִדְרָשׁ) - "Study / Investigation / Exposition"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From the root d-r-sh ("to seek, inquire, investigate"). In 2 Chronicles 13:22, the "midrash of the prophet Iddo" is referenced. In Jewish tradition, Midrash became a major genre of biblical interpretation -- the rabbinic commentary literature that explores Scripture through exposition, narrative, and homily.

**Reformed Theological Alignment: COMPLICATED**
While the root meaning ("investigation, inquiry") is appealing, "Midrash" carries extremely strong associations with rabbinic Judaism. The midrashic method of interpretation is fundamentally different from the Reformed hermeneutical tradition:
- Midrash often reads multiple meanings into a text, embraces apparent contradictions, and uses associative logic.
- Reformed hermeneutics (following Calvin's grammatical-historical method) seeks the single intended meaning of the text in its historical context.

Naming a Reformed app "Midrash" would create confusion about the hermeneutical approach and could be seen as culturally insensitive -- appropriating a distinctly Jewish scholarly tradition for a Christian purpose.

**Commercial Availability:** PARTIALLY TAKEN. "Torah Educational Software" has Midrash-related products. "MiDRASH" is an international manuscript digitization project (midrash.eu). "Esh Midrash Halacha" is an existing app.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: ELIMINATED**
The rabbinic association is too strong and potentially misleading for a Reformed Christian platform. It suggests a hermeneutical approach that Reformed theology explicitly rejects. Also commercially crowded.

## Part II: Greek Candidates

### 8. Paradosis (Παράδοσις) - "Tradition / That Which is Handed Down"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From para ("alongside") + didonai ("to give"). Used in the NT both positively (1 Corinthians 11:2, 2 Thessalonians 2:15 -- "hold to the traditions [paradoseis] which you were taught") and negatively (Mark 7:3, 5, 8 -- the "traditions of the elders" that nullify God's word).

**Reformed Theological Alignment: HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC**
This is the most theologically sensitive candidate. 2 Thessalonians 2:15 is one of the most hotly debated verses between Reformed Protestants and Roman Catholic / Eastern Orthodox theologians:

- **Catholic/Orthodox position:** Paradosis in 2 Thess 2:15 proves that oral tradition carries authority alongside written Scripture. The Church preserves an unwritten paradosis that Protestants have rejected.
- **Reformed position:** The paradosis Paul mentions is the same content whether delivered orally or in writing -- it is now fully preserved in the inscripturated New Testament. Sola Scriptura stands.

This debate is not obscure -- it is front-and-center in ecumenical and apologetic discussions. Ligonier Ministries (one of the key content sources for this app) has a devotional specifically titled "Standing on the Apostolic Tradition" that carefully navigates this terminology.

Naming a Reformed church history app "Paradosis" would be like naming a Protestant bookstore "Magisterium" -- it adopts the vocabulary of the opposing theological position. Any Reformed seminary student or pastor would immediately notice the irony. It could be seen as either endorsing the Catholic understanding of tradition or as carelessly appropriating a term that sits at the heart of a foundational Reformation debate.

**Pronunciation:** pah-RAH-doh-sis. Four syllables, moderately difficult.

**Commercial Availability:** Clear. No major tech companies found.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: ELIMINATED**
Despite commercial availability, Paradosis is theologically inappropriate for a specifically Reformed platform. The word is ground zero for the sola Scriptura debate. Using it would undermine the app's Reformed identity.

**Note on the Researcher's ranking:** The Researcher ranked Paradosis #3 and noted its "strong Reformed connection" based on Paul's usage. I respectfully but firmly disagree. Paul's usage of paradosis is precisely the text that Catholic and Orthodox apologists use *against* the Reformed position. The word is theologically contested, not theologically supportive of the Reformed tradition. This is a case where surface-level meaning ("handing down tradition -- that's what church history is!") obscures a deeper theological problem.

---

### 9. Didache (Διδαχή) - "Teaching / Doctrine"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From didasko ("I teach"). The Didache is also the name of an important early Christian document (c. AD 50-120), "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," which provides instructions on baptism, fasting, prayer, and church order.

**Reformed Theological Alignment: GOOD**
Teaching and doctrine are central to the Reformed tradition. The Didache as a historical document is valued by church historians (including Reformed scholars) as a window into early church practice.

**Commercial Availability:** TAKEN. A Catholic daily Bible reflection app called "Didache" exists on Google Play and iOS.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: ELIMINATED**
Good theological fit but commercially taken by a Catholic app, which would create confusion for a Reformed product.

---

### 10. Paideia (Παιδεία) - "Education / Formation / Training"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
The classical Greek concept of holistic education. In the NT, used in Ephesians 6:4 ("bring them up in the paideia and instruction of the Lord") and Hebrews 12:5-11 (God's paideia/discipline of His children).

**Reformed Theological Alignment: STRONG**
The Reformed tradition emphasizes education deeply. Calvin founded the Geneva Academy; the Westminster Assembly produced catechisms; the Puritans established Harvard and Yale for ministerial training. "Paideia" captures this holistic vision of Christian formation through learning.

**Commercial Availability:** TAKEN. Multiple active EdTech companies: PaideIA (learning platform at paide-ia.app), Paideia Educational Solutions, Paideia Labs Inc. (paideia.io).

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: ELIMINATED**
Excellent theological fit but the name is saturated in the EdTech space. Impossible to differentiate.

---

### 11. Mathetes (Μαθητής) - "Disciple / Learner"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From manthano ("to learn"). The standard NT word for "disciple" -- used 261 times in the Gospels and Acts. Every follower of Jesus is a mathetes.

**Reformed Theological Alignment: GOOD**
The concept of discipleship is universal across Christian traditions, including Reformed. However, "mathetes" does not have a specifically Reformed resonance -- it is equally at home in Baptist, Pentecostal, or Catholic contexts.

**Commercial Availability:** PARTIALLY TAKEN. Mathetes.io (Bible class tool), Mathetes Inc. (fine art), Mathetis (World Bible School platform).

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: RANK #5**
Good general meaning but lacks Reformed distinctiveness, and the name space is partially occupied.

---

### 12. Mneme (Μνήμη) - "Memory / Remembrance"

**Commercial Availability:** TAKEN. Mneme AI is an active iOS app.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: ELIMINATED**
Commercially unavailable.

---

### 13. Ekklesia (Ἐκκλησία) - "Church / Assembly"

**Commercial Availability:** HEAVILY TAKEN. Multiple church management software platforms (Ekklesia Solutions, Ekklesia 360, Ecclesia App, Ekklesiasys, My-Ecclesia, etc.).

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: ELIMINATED**
The most saturated name in the entire church tech space.

---

### 14. Didasko (Διδάσκω) - "I Teach"

**Commercial Availability:** TAKEN. Didasko Online is a major Australian LMS company with 25+ years of operation, awards, and active products.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: ELIMINATED**
Commercially unavailable -- a well-established EdTech company owns this name.

---

### 15. Anamnesis (Ἀνάμνησις) - "Remembrance / Calling to Mind"

**Etymology & Biblical Usage:**
From ana ("back") + mimneskesthai ("to recall"). Used in Luke 22:19 and 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 ("Do this in remembrance [anamnesis] of me"). In philosophy, Plato's theory that learning is recollection of Forms the soul knew before incarnation.

**Reformed Theological Alignment: MIXED**
The Eucharistic connection is strong. Calvin's view of the Lord's Supper emphasizes genuine spiritual nourishment through remembrance (against both bare memorialism and transubstantiation). However:
- The Platonic association (learning as recollection of pre-existent knowledge) is philosophically incompatible with Reformed epistemology, which grounds knowledge in divine revelation, not innate recollection.
- The word primarily evokes the Lord's Supper, not historical learning.

**Commercial Availability:** PARTIALLY TAKEN. Multiple products: Anamnesis on Steam (horror game), Anamnesis on GitHub (FFXIV screenshot tool), Anamnesis clipboard manager on SourceForge.

**THEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT: RANK #4**
The dual meaning (liturgical remembrance + Platonic recollection) is intellectually interesting but practically confusing. The Platonic dimension is theologically awkward for a Reformed platform. Multiple existing software products share the name.

## Part III: Final Rankings

### Tier 1: Strong Recommendations

| Rank | Name | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|------|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **#1** | **Toledot** | **9.5/10** | Perfect semantic + theological fit for Reformed church history | Three syllables (slightly longer) |
| **#2** | **Maskil** | **8.0/10** | Short, memorable, Psalm-derived | Emphasizes wisdom, not history; Haskalah association |

### Tier 2: Viable Alternatives

| Rank | Name | Score | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|------|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| #3 | Talmid | 6.5/10 | "Learner/disciple" is clear | Some existing religious education usage |
| #4 | Anamnesis | 6.0/10 | Intellectually rich dual meaning | Multiple existing products; Platonic baggage |
| #5 | Mathetes | 5.5/10 | Universal NT term for disciple | Lacks Reformed distinctiveness; partial conflicts |

### Tier 3: Eliminated

| Name | Reason for Elimination |
|------|----------------------|
| Paradosis | Theologically problematic -- ground zero for sola Scriptura debate |
| Masoret | "Tradition" is loaded in Reformed theology; commercially taken |
| Midrash | Strongly associated with rabbinic Judaism; hermeneutical mismatch |
| Didache | Commercially taken (Catholic app) |
| Paideia | Commercially saturated in EdTech |
| Ekklesia | Heavily taken in church tech |
| Didasko | Taken by major LMS company |
| Mneme | Taken (Mneme AI) |
| Binah | Taken (Binah.ai) |
| Chronica | Taken (existing history apps) |
| Mikra | Semantic mismatch; commercial conflicts |
| Hokmah | Pronunciation barrier for English speakers |

---

## Part IV: Response to Researcher's Analysis

The Researcher's `p0-name-research.md` is thorough and well-structured. I agree with the top two picks (Toledot #1, Maskil #2) and the elimination of commercially taken names.

**Where I diverge:**

1. **Paradosis (Researcher's #3):** I have moved this to "Eliminated." The Researcher noted a "strong Reformed connection" based on Paul's usage in 2 Thessalonians 2:15. However, this is precisely the verse that Catholic and Orthodox apologists cite *against* sola Scriptura. The word paradosis is not a Reformed-friendly term -- it is a contested theological term that sits at the center of the Reformation's defining debate. For a platform explicitly rooted in the Reformed tradition, drawing content from Ligonier Ministries and Reformed seminaries, this name would be tonally wrong.

2. **Anamnesis (Researcher's #4):** I agree this is interesting but have noted the Platonic philosophical baggage and the multiple existing software products. It drops slightly in my ranking.

3. **Talmid (Researcher's #5):** I agree with the moderate assessment. The small existing organizations are a minor concern.

---

## Part V: Final Recommendation

### The app should be named **Toledot**.

**The case for Toledot in one paragraph:**

Toledot is the Hebrew word that structures the entire book of Genesis, introducing each new epoch in God's redemptive plan with the formula "These are the toledot of..." It means "the generations that followed, the historical account of what came forth." For a church history learning platform rooted in the Reformed tradition -- which uniquely emphasizes redemptive-historical theology, covenant succession across generations, and the progressive unfolding of God's plan -- no other word captures the mission so precisely. The app traces the toledot of Christ's church: from the apostolic era through the patristic fathers, through the medieval period, through the Reformation, and into the modern age. Each era is a new toledot -- a new chapter in what God brought forth through His people. The word is commercially clear, easy to pronounce, and deeply, specifically biblical.

**Tagline suggestion:** *Toledot -- The Generations of the Church*

**If the team prefers a shorter, punchier name:** Maskil is the strong alternative, with the tagline *Maskil -- Learn with Wisdom*.
