| Pronunciation | Good - TOH-leh-doht, intuitive for English speakers |
| Memorability | Strong - unique, distinctive, easy to spell |
| Availability | Excellent - no tech company, app, or product uses this name |
| Reformed Connection | Deep - central structural word in Genesis; connects to the Reformed emphasis on covenant history and redemptive-historical theology |

**Why #1:** Toledot is the structuring device of Genesis ("These are the toledot of..."), making it a theologically rich word that literally means "historical account." For a church history learning platform rooted in the Reformed tradition, which emphasizes redemptive history and God's work across generations, this name is deeply fitting. It is completely available in the tech/software space.

---

### #2: Maskil (מַשְׂכִּיל)
**"Wise / Learned / Enlightened"**

| Criteria | Rating |
|---|---|
| Meaning & Relevance | Excellent - means "one who has insight/understanding" |
| Pronunciation | Good - MAHS-keel, easy for English speakers |
| Memorability | Strong - short, distinctive, easy to remember |
| Availability | Very Good - no tech product, app, or company uses this name |
| Reformed Connection | Good - the Psalms superscription connects to wisdom literature; the Haskalah meaning of "enlightened" connects to learning |

**Why #2:** Maskil directly conveys the idea of being a wise, learned person - exactly what the platform aims to cultivate. Its use in Psalm superscriptions gives it biblical gravitas, and it's short and memorable. No conflicts in the tech space.

### #3: Paradosis (Παράδοσις)
**"Tradition / That Which is Handed Down"**

| Criteria | Rating |
|---|---|
| Meaning & Relevance | Excellent - means "handing down of tradition" (2 Thess. 2:15) |

**Why #3:** Paradosis captures the essence of church history - the faithful transmission of apostolic teaching across generations. Paul himself uses this word in 2 Thessalonians 2:15 ("hold to the traditions [paradoseis] which you were taught"). The name is available, though slightly longer.

---

### #4: Anamnesis (Ἀνάμνησις)
**"Remembrance / Recollection / Calling to Mind"**

| Criteria | Rating |
|---|---|
| Meaning & Relevance | Excellent - dual meaning: Platonic learning-as-recollection AND Christian Eucharistic remembrance |
| Pronunciation | Moderate - an-am-NEE-sis, recognizable to educated English speakers |
| Memorability | Moderate - longer word but has intellectual cachet |
| Availability | Excellent - no tech company, app, or product found |
| Reformed Connection | Strong - connects to "Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19), central to Reformed theology of the Lord's Supper |

**Why #4:** Anamnesis beautifully bridges learning (Plato's theory that learning is recollection) and church practice (Eucharistic remembrance). It's completely available in the tech space. The main drawback is length and slightly more complex pronunciation.

### #5: Talmid (תַּלְמִיד)
**"Disciple / Learner / Student"**

| Criteria | Rating |
|---|---|
| Meaning & Relevance | Excellent - means "learner/disciple," from the root "to learn" |
| Pronunciation | Good - tahl-MEED, straightforward |
| Memorability | Strong - short and distinctive |

| Reformed Connection | Good - the concept of discipleship and lifelong learning is core to the Reformed tradition |

**Why #5:** Talmid directly means "learner" - the most straightforward name for a learning platform. It shares the same root as "Talmud" (study/learning), giving it instant association with deep study. The minor concern is that a few small religious education organizations use similar names.

## Honorable Mentions

- **Hokhmah** (Wisdom) - Great meaning but pronunciation is challenging for English speakers
- **Moreh** (Teacher) - Available but too generic
- **Zikkaron** (Memorial) - Good but some existing cultural usage

---

## Recommendation

**Toledot** is the strongest candidate overall. It is:
- Completely available (no trademark/company conflicts)
- Deeply meaningful for a church history platform (literally means "historical account/generations")
- Theologically significant in the Reformed tradition (covenant history, redemptive-historical interpretation)
- Easy to pronounce and remember for English speakers
- Distinctive and brandable

**Maskil** is the strong runner-up, offering a shorter, punchier alternative that emphasizes the "learning/wisdom" aspect rather than the "history" aspect.

The team should consider whether the app's identity leans more toward **history** (Toledot) or **learning/wisdom** (Maskil) when making the final decision.
